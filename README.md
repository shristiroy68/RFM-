# RFM- For Customer Analysis Problem
RFM analysis allows you to segment customers by the frequency and value of purchases and identify those customers who spend the most money.

Recency – how long it’s been since a customer bought something from you
Frequency – how often a customer buys from you
Monetary value – the total value of purchases a customer has made
